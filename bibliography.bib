	abstract = {This paper presents a review of the literature on personnel scheduling problems. Firstly, we discuss the classification methods in former review papers. Secondly, we evaluate the literature in the many fields that are related to either the problem setting or the technical features. Each perspective is presented as a table in which the classification is displayed. This method facilitates the identification of manuscripts related to the reader’s specific interests. Throughout the literature review, we identify trends in research on personnel staffing and scheduling, and we indicate which areas should be subject to future research.}
