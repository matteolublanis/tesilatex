	abstract = {This paper presents a review of the literature on personnel scheduling problems. Firstly, we discuss the classification methods in former review papers. Secondly, we evaluate the literature in the many fields that are related to either the problem setting or the technical features. Each perspective is presented as a table in which the classification is displayed. This method facilitates the identification of manuscripts related to the reader’s specific interests. Throughout the literature review, we identify trends in research on personnel staffing and scheduling, and we indicate which areas should be subject to future research.}

	abstract = {Personnel-scheduling problems for continuously operating organizations have proven to be difficult to solve optimally. As a consequence, a number of alternative approaches have been devised for solving these problems. We provide computational results of a study of the staffing costs obtained using a prominent alternative formulation approach. The results demonstrate that excess staffing costs may result from the use of this approach. We subsequently develop a new local-search heuristic based on the simulated annealing algorithm to generate feasible integer personnel schedules in continuously operating organizations. The solution costs and computational effort associated with the new heuristic are shown to be generally superior to those of branch-and-bound integer programming.}
