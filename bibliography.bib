	abstract = {In the context of manpower planning, goal programming (GP) is extremely useful for generating shift duties of fixed length. A fixed-length duty consists of a fixed number of contiguous hours of work in a day, with a meal/rest break somewhere preferably around the middle of these working hours. It is such properties that enable the straightforward, yet flexible GP modeling. We propose GP models for an integrated problem of crew duties assignment, for baggage services section staff at the Hong Kong International Airport. The problem is solved via decomposition into its duties generating phase—a GP planner, followed by its GP scheduling and rostering phase. The results can be adopted as a good crew schedule in the sense that it is both feasible, satisfying various work conditions, and “optimal” in minimizing idle shifts.}

Furthermore, we address complexity issues by identifying polynomial solvable and NP-hard special cases.}

	abstract = {Personnel rostering is a personnel scheduling problem in which shifts are assigned to employees, subject to complex organisational and contractual time-related constraints. Academic advances in this domain mainly focus on solving specific variants of this problem using intricate exact or (meta)heuristic algorithms, while little attention has been devoted to studying the underlying structure of the problems. The general assumption is that these problems, even in their most simplified form, are NP-hard. However, such claims are rarely supported with a proof for the problem under study. The present paper refutes this assumption by presenting minimum cost network flow formulations for several personnel rostering problems. Additionally, these problems are situated among the existing academic literature to obtain insights into what makes personnel rostering hard.}
