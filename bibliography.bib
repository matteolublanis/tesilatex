Secondly, we evaluate the literature in the many fields that are related to either the problem setting or the technical features. Each perspective is presented as a table in which the classification is displayed. This method facilitates the identification of manuscripts related to the reader’s specific interests. Throughout the literature review, we identify trends in research on personnel staffing and scheduling, and we indicate which areas should be subject to future research.}

	abstract = {Personnel-scheduling problems for continuously operating organizations have proven to be difficult to solve optimally. As a consequence, a number of alternative approaches have been devised for solving these problems. We provide computational results of a study of the staffing costs obtained using a prominent alternative formulation approach. The results demonstrate that excess staffing costs may result from the use of this approach. We subsequently develop a new local-search heuristic based on the simulated annealing algorithm to generate feasible integer personnel schedules in continuously operating organizations. The solution costs and computational effort associated with the new heuristic are shown to be generally superior to those of branch-and-bound integer programming.}

	abstract = {Retailers must frequently deal with alterations in planned customer service levels due to unexpected demand variations or unscheduled employee absences. Although personnel scheduling techniques have been extensively studied and successfully applied, previous treatments of scheduling adjustments in response to demand and employee contingencies have not systematically considered all of the relevant issues. After presenting a mathematical specification of the problem, this study develops various algorithms that search for the best adjustments among all available contingency recovery resources, including transfers of multiskilled employees between different store areas. The proposed formulations also permit interaction between the user/decision maker and the affected employees. The underlying objective is to maximize profits, favoring solutions with fewer schedule modifications in order to minimize worker dissatisfaction. Due to the complexity of the basic model, the problem is divided and simplified using two greedy heuristics. Both algorithms can be implemented with real-world size problems and reach good solutions within minutes. Multiskilled employees prove to be an important reserve capacity for recovery of service levels in the face of unexpected variations. Empirical results using real data from a Chilean chain retailer show that in the worst scenario, the proposed model's schedule adjustments reduced lost profits due to unexpected variations by 18\%.}

	abstract = {Since customer volume in a supermarket store is constantly fluctuating during a day and through the week, cashier scheduling is not an easy task. To create an accurate schedule, a supermarket manager must spend a good deal of time trying to match cashier shifts to customer demand. In this paper, a shift selection integer linear programming model is presented which has been implemented in Stop & Shop supermarket stores in Boston Massachusetts. The model runs on a personal computer within an electronic spreadsheet environment, making it user friendly for managers. It considers both hourly labor demand constraints and availability of labor constraints for each day of the week.}

However, there is a relatively low level of study on models and complexity in these important problems. In this paper, we present mathematical models which cover specific aspects in the personnel scheduling literature. Furthermore, we address complexity issues by identifying polynomial solvable and NP-hard special cases.}
